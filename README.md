Code and example data corresponding to the manuscript "The architecture of brain co-expression reveals the brain-wide basis of disease susceptibility"

This repository provides code and example data for the following components of the manuscript:
  + Data Preprocessing [covariate selection]
  + Network construction [robust WGCNA, ARACNe-AP, GLASSO, vMF-clustering, tensor decomposition, hierarchical merging]
  + Module evaluation

Most of the evaluation code relies on a secondary repository, BrainGenesetAnnotation, which is available as a zip file in the resources/ directory.

For each component, please see the readme file within the parent directory.
