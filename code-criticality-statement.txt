# Critical Componenets

The critical components of an analysis pipeline we define as those steps that are:
  + Central to the conclusion
  + Not validated with concordance with other approaches
  + Not an existing, already-established software package
  + Not validated with orthogonal, biological data

Because it represents a novel analytical approach for examining network genetic
architecture, for which no algorithmic approaches currently exist, and which is
difficult to validate experimentally, we view our network architecture analysis
as a critical software component. This includes:
  + Simulation of the architecture
  + Various computations of network distance
  + Curated gene mutational burden scores
  + Computation of the phi-hat statistic

This critical component, required data, and test data sets appear in the
omnigenics/ subdirectory.


# Non-critical components

We also include non-critical components in this repository to assist
in reproducibility, or to provide complete detail of our methods. These methods
are as follows:

 + Robust WGCNA (previously described)
 + ARACNe-AP    (previously described)
 + GALSSO       (previously described)
 + vMF-mix      (validated via concordance)
 + Learning curves (simple subsampling and application of previously-described method)
 + Hierarchical network merging (simple variant of hierarchical clustering)
 + Tensor decomposition clustering (validated via concordance with hierarchically merged networks)
 + Various module evaluation tools (many previously-described methods, or standalone applications of GLMs
                                    or GAMs of the form  "in.module ~ some.predictor + covariates")
 + Cell type decomposition (previously described)
 + MAGMA gene enrichment   (previously described)
 + Correlation based cell-specific isoforms (simple ad-hoc analysis, validated with orthogonal sorted-cell sequencing)
 + lncRNA analysis (previously-described machine learning method [xgboost])
